# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning-

This project uses machine learning to recommend suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The system leverages a Random Forest classifier for predictions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained Random Forest Classifier.
- **GUI Application**: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter for crop prediction.
- **Input Parameters**: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- **Output**: Recommended crop based on the input parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in `crop_recommendation.csv`. It contains soil and environmental data with corresponding crop labels.
